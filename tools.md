# IDE
## PHPstorm
I currently use PHPStorm as my IDE. While it might not be free, it does everything I need to do and it does those things well.

I also find new features keep getting added bloating the software. One of the recent additions was to merge all the features from their other product [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) into PHPStorm. This provides it pretty good database management tools, which allowed me to pretty much ditch MySQL Workbench, which I was more than happy to do.

--------
# Database Management
## PHPStorm
Thanks to the expansion and improvements of PHPStorm I now use this as my main database management tool. It makes things super simple by allowing me to simple press Ctrl + Enter while having the cursor inside a query in my code and it will run the query, even asking me the value of any bound parameters.
## MySQL Workbench
I still unfortunately have to use MySQL Workbench for a few things, such as table creation. This is due to PHPStorm not quite being as fully featured in this area as I would like it to be.

--------
# Shell
## Zsh
I use Zshell with "cobalt" skin applied using [Oh My Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/). I mainly use Zsh since it has a few extra features than bash, although I probably don't end up using those nice extra features. The main reason though is that I can apply really nice skins to it, giving it both style and substance.
